File Handling in Java

1.  In FirstFile.java we have handled the file using byteStream
2.  In SecondFile.java we have handled the file using DataStream
3.  In ThirdFile.java we have handled the file using Character Stream
4.  In FourthFile.java we have handled the file using Serialization and Desrailization
5.  In Problem.java we have handled the file in a way that first input some data in
    a file and copied it to another file and finally displayed from the copied file.
